# Memory Game Application

Match pictures and try to beat your high score

## Game Design Goals 

The game should start off with a main menu, allowing the user to tap on Play or to tap on Leaderboard, The Play button will open the main game
where the player is greeted with 3 radio buttons, 4x4 6x6 and 8x8 (easy, medium, hard).
The game is started once the player clicks on one of the hidden cards.
The timer should start and the card should flip, the player has to remember the card and once he clicks on a different card,
the previous card he clicked should flip over, unless he matches the card, both should stay revealed.
The timer will be stopped when the last cards are matched.
This information is then saved on to a file based on the dificulty and then sorted based on its time.
The leaderboard button in the main menu should then display this users time and ranking.
